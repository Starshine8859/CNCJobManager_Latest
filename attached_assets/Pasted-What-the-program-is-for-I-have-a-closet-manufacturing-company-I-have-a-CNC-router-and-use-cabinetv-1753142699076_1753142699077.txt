What the program is for
I have a closet manufacturing company, I have a CNC router and use cabinetvision to produce G-Code to send to the CNC. There can be many types of material in a single job.

I need 2 things:
1)	I want to be able to put into a job the amount of sheet and in a separate space color material (maybe a spreadsheet) and when it’s being cut the operator should just check off what was already done, and I want to be able to see it across all network computers. I also need to be able to add recut sheets to the original files (pieces very often move on tha CNC and get damaged so I need to be able to put more sheets into the same job.
2)	I want it to time (and get a report) on how ling every job takes. I was thinking maybe when they go into another job it starts timing that job, maybe you have a better sugestion)
What data you’ll enter
1)	Customer name and Job name (this will be the file name)
2)	Qty of sheets
3)	Material Color
What you want the program to do with that data
1)	Show me in real time  what is cut and what still needs to be cut
2)	Generate a report of how long each project took (the report should include if the project still has sheets that still need to be done)
3)	Maybe also divide the jobs in general tabs of “Waiting”, “In Progress”, “Done”
We use windows computers in the shop (the computer I’m using now has windows server 2012
Do it whatever way works best
add a place in the backend where I can add all the colors I use and then I should have both options of writing or dropdown when selecting a color. Also I want to have a place in the backend where I can import textures to be displayed
Add color groups (I want to be able to add, rename and remove groups from the backend
add a place where I can view the jobs w/o time tracking (password protected and needs to have an option of “forgot password)
make 2 admin categories View only admin or admin (admin will be able to add remove usernames and passwords
I want a search option to find old jobs, jobs should be dated. also I want to be able to search colors so I don't need to go through the full list every time I enter a new color
include a one-click setup
